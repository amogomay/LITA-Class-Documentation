- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Entry and Cleaning
  2. For Analysis 
  3. For visualisation
- SQL-Structured Query Language for Querying of Data

### SQL- Structured query Language
This is where we include some basic lines ofcode or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during analysis
 For example;

- SELECT statenments for Data retrieval
- FORM and JOIN clauses for data combination
- WHERE and HAVING for filtering
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY for data aggregation

  Some SQL command include
  - SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE
  - CREATE
  - DROP
  - ALTER
  - TRUNCATE
  - CASE WHEN
 ``` SQL
- SELECT * FROM TABLE EMPLOYEE
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  ```
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about Data such as;
 - What is the overall trend
 - Which products are top sellers
 - Which region is performing the most
 - What are the products on peak sales


### GitHUB.
Github is a valuable tool for data Analyst to effectively manage and collaborate on their portfolio projects. It is a cloud based platform for person control and collaboration with potential employers and clients.

We learnt the following;
- Creating Account on Github
- Creating Repository
- Collaborating with others
- Pull request and lots more.

### Power BI
